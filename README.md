# Open-Freedom-License

A modern, fully permissive open-source license — OSI-compatible spirit, zero restrictions on use/modification/commercialization, with crystal-clear wording. Do whatever you want with anything that this license covers. No strings attached.

Features: • Explicit list of granted rights (use, copy, modify, distribute, sublicense, commercial integration) • Standard no-endorsement clause to protect the author's name • Comprehensive "AS IS" disclaimer with broad liability protection • Clean, readable structure — no legalese bloat


We currently just submitted to OSI. if The license gets approved you will see OFL or OFL-1.0 on this repository, that is the open freedom license 1.0.
