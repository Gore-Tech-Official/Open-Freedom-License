# Open-Freedom-License

A modern, fully permissive open-source license — OSI-compatible spirit, zero restrictions on use/modification/commercialization, with crystal-clear wording. Do whatever you want with anything that this license covers. No strings attached.

Features: 
• Explicit list of granted rights (use, copy, modify, distribute, sublicense, commercial integration) 
• Standard no-endorsement clause to protect the author's name 
• Comprehensive "AS IS" disclaimer with broad liability protection 
• Clean, readable structure — no legalese bloat
